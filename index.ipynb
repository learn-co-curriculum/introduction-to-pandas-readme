    "Another library that is integral to data science is Pandas. Have you ever looked at a table of data, maybe excel, and thought, \"I wish I had that in a format I could use in Python!\"? We'll you're in luck because that is exactly the type of problem that this new library can solve for us. In this lesson, we will introduce the ways in which Pandas is used and why it is such a powerful tool. We'll also show exactly how to get started using Pandas and common operations. "
